### **Java Media Player with JAVAFX**
- A lightweight project I built while learning java:

- Below are screenshots of the Media player:

- It has a Simple Method to Extract Media Name from the path directory shown in the code.
- It's pretty basic and only plays MP4 files

- To Use on Windows uncomment the windows block comment on MainClass.java and block comment the Linux block.
```

/*	 // On Windows OS
         String [] mediaTitleParts = MEDIA_URL.split(":");
         String mediaTitleSecondPart = mediaTitleParts [1];
         System.out.println(mediaTitleSecondPart);
         String [] MediaTitlePartsMain = mediaTitleSecondPart.split("\\\\");
         MediaClass the Title part which usually the last String after split
 */

	// On Linux and Mac
	String [] MediaTitlePartsMain = MEDIA_URL.split("/");
	//MediaClass the Title part which usually the last String after split
	String MediaTitle = MediaTitlePartsMain [MediaTitlePartsMain.length - 1];
```
